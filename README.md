# google-keys
Enables the conkeror keys on google search pages

"I want my keys back!" Here they are:

If for some reason you use google search with for instance a firefox
or chrome useragent, google will capture many of your keys.

Put this script into your conkeror scripts folder and you can use
conkeror keys again as usual.

Alternatively you can put it into the folder .conkerorrc/modules, use
http://jaderholm.com/paste/%2521add_user_modules_path.js.html and put
require("google-key-rescue"); somewhere into your configuration
file(s).

Please note, that this script does not provide a mechanism to revert
its effect: But why would you use conkeror if you don't want to use
its keys?
